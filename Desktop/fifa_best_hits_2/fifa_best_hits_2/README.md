# FIFA BEST HITS
by Javier Noriega

This personal project is a Flutter Mobile Application that works for both Android and iOS (Phone and Tablet)


The main screen is a list with all the FIFAs, if you tap of the FIFAs a new screen pops up with the Best Hits from that FIFA and if you tap one of the songs it will redirect you to a YouTube Search of the same.

There is also a search bar where you can type the name of a song and see if that song is in the list.

I am planning on doing some more add-ons to this project in the future, but for now...
Feel free to do whatever you want with this project :)
